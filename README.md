Soccermetrics API Python Client
===============================

This is a Python module for using the Soccermetrics REST API.

# Installation

The Soccermetrics API Python client library depends on the
[Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) and
[easydict](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/easydict/) libraries.  You can install
the client library within a virtual environment on your computer, or install
it system-wide.

Python 2.6+ is required.  The module *might* work with Python 3, but we
haven't tested it and give no guarantees.

It's not required, but [autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv) is
very nice to have.

## Virtual Environment Install

We recommend installing `soccermetrics-client-py` within a virtual environment
using `virtualenv`.  That way you can run different versions of Python
installations and libraries without dealing with conflicting dependencies.

We also recommend installing [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
As it says on the label, it is a wrapper around `virtualenv` that manages the virtual
environments on your machine and allows you to customize pre- and post-activation
(and deactivation) behavior, such as setting environment variables or opening your text editor.

Here is a link to [a nice tutorial on Virtualenv](http://sccr.mx/TXAL2F).
And [a tutorial on virtualenvwrapper](http://sccr.mx/1pZ5Xtx) as well.

To install `virtualenv` on MacOS or Linux, create a folder and run one of these
two commands as `sudo`:

    $ sudo easy_install virtualenv

or

    $ sudo pip install virtualenv

If you are on Windows, [this link](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/#windows-easy-install)
will show you how to install `pip` and `distribute`, which you will use to
install `virtualenv`.

Download [the current zipped version of the source code]
(https://github.com/soccermetrics/soccermetrics-client-py/archive/master.zip)
from GitHub, unzip the folder and run:

    $ make install

## System-Wide Install

If you want to install `soccermetrics-client-py` system-wide -- not recommended
because of possible library conflicts -- download

from GitHub, unzip the folder and run:

    $ make install

# Getting Started

To start using the Soccermetrics API, create a `SoccermetricsRestClient`.

## API Credentials

You'll need your Soccermetrics API credentials to use the `SoccermetricsRestClient`.
These get passed to the constructor directly or via environment variables.

```python
from soccermetrics.rest import SoccermetricsRestClient

appID = "f53baabb"
appKey = "demo1234567890demo1234567890"

client = SoccermetricsRestClient(account=appID,api_key=appKey)
```

If you call `SoccermetricsRestClient` without any parameters, the constructor
will look for `SOCCERMETRICS_APP_ID` and `SOCCERMETRICS_APP_KEY` variables
inside the current environment.

We recommend that you keep your credentials in environment variables.
That way you won't have to worry about accidentally posting your credentials
in a public place.

```python
from soccermetrics.rest import SoccermetricsRestClient
client = SoccermetricsRestClient()
```

## Get Match Information

```python
from soccermetrics.rest import SoccermetricsRestClient

appID = "f53baabb"
appKey = "demo1234567890demo1234567890"
client = SoccermetricsRestClient()

# club teams
match = client.club.match.information.get(home_team_name="Everton",
                                     away_team_name="Liverpool").data[0]
print match.matchDate, match.kickoffTime

lineup_data = client.link.get(match.link.lineups, is_starting=True).all()
for datum in lineup_data:
    print datum.playerName, datum.playerTeamName

# national teams
natl_match = client.natl.match.information.get(
                home_team_name="Brazil", away_team_name="Croatia",phase="Group").data[0]
lineup_data = client.link.get(match.link.lineups, is_starting=True).all()
for datum in lineup_data:
    print datum.playerName, datum.playerTeamName
```

## Get Player Statistical Data

```python
from soccermetrics.rest import SoccermetricsRestClient

appID = "f53baabb"
appKey = "demo1234567890demo1234567890"
client = SoccermetricsRestClient()

player = client.players.get(full_name=u'Robin van Persie').data[0]
# goals at club level
goals = client.link.get(player.link.club.goals)
penalties = client.link.get(player.link.club.penalties,outcome_type="Goal")
# goals at national team level
natl_team_goals = client.link.get(player.link.natl.goals)
natl_team_pens = client.link.get(player.link.natl.penalties,outcome_type="Goal")
```

## Get Advanced Analytics

```python
from soccermetrics.rest import SoccermetricsRestClient
client = SoccermetricsRestClient()

match = client.club.match.information.get(home_team_name='Manchester United', away_team_name='Stoke City').data[0]

match_state_46 = client.link.get(match.link.analytics.match.state,time_mins=46)
match_state_75 = client.link.get(match.link.analytics.match.state,time_mins=75)
match_state_final = client.link.get(match.link.analytics.match.state)
match_segments = client.link.get(match.link.analytics.match.segment)
```
